# BBO-Bioinformatics-Bash-Oneliner
Hi bioinformaticans and bash learner, welcome to BBO, Bioinformatics Bash Oneliner learning station. I started studying bioinformatics data three years ago, and my cs friend install Ubuntu on my lab computer. I was amazed by those single-word bash commands which are much faster than my dull scripts, so i started and insist using bash. Not all the code here is oneliner (if the ';' counts..), but i put effort on making them brief and fast.

This blog will focus on bash commands for parsing biological data, most of which are tsv files (tab-separated values); some of them are for Ubuntu system maintaining. I have been recording the bash commands on my notebook, but putting them on web will help others and myself to 'Ctrl +F '. I apologize that there won't be any citation for the codes, coz i haven't make any record of it, but they are probably from dear Google and Stackoverflow.

English and bash are not my first language, so... correct me anytime, sorry
